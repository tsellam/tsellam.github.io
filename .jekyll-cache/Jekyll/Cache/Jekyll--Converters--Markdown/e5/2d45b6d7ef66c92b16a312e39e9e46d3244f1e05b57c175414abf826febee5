	<h1>Teaching and Mentoring</h1>
	<p>I guest lectured for Columbia's <a href="http://columbiaviz.github.io">data exploration</a> and database classes.
	I also had the chance to work with a few talented students from the <a href="https://cudbg.github.io/lab/">WuLab</a>, including <a href="http://www.zhanghaoci.com/">Haoci Zhang</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-lin-32a44633/">Kevin Lin</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-huang-171b88127/">Ian Huang</a>.

	<h1>Other experience</h1>
    <p>
    Before I started my PhD, I had a technology role at <a href="http://www.jpmorgan.com/pages/jpmorgan">JPMorgan</a> (investment
    banking) for a year.
	</p>
	<p>
	I wrote my Master's thesis in the
    <a href="http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/udbl"> database group</a> of
    Uppsala University, in Sweden. I developed a Naive Bayes classifier for a
    DBMS, and used it on a stream of Twitter messages to detect emotions. You may
    find the text <a href="ThibaultSellamMSc.pdf">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	I play lots of music, and I attend as many concerts as I can. Between January and September 2015, I toured with a music band. We
       achieved a lot, I will happily share tour stories upon request.
