   I am an engineer at Google Research in NYC, in the <a href="https://ai.google/research/teams/language/">Language</a> team. I am interested in anything that involves AI and people. Relevant keywords are language generation, language understanding, ML interpretability, and data exploration.
    </p>

   <p>Previously, I was a postdoctoral research scientist at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia</a>, in New York, in <a href="https://cudbg.github.io/lab/">the WuLab group</a>.
  Before this, I was a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.uva.nl/en/home">University of Amsterdam</a> and <a href="www.cwi.nl">CWI</a> (the Netherlands) in the <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/research/groups/database-architectures">database group</a>, after a year spent as a software engineer at JP Morgan in London (UK).</p>

   <p>I am also a music nerd&mdash;when I am not at the office, you may find me play with a band, an orchestra or enjoy one of New York's many music venues. I also like to apply ML to music, see examples <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-01-Secret-Sauce-data %}">here</a>.</p>
