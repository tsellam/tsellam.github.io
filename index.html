   I am a postdoc at the <a href="https://cudbg.github.io/lab/">WuLab</a>, within the <a href="http://datascience.columbia.edu/">Data Science Institute</a> of <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>, in New York. I build systems to help data scientists <b>interact</b> with <b>complex statistical models</b> (e.g., deep neural networks) and <b>large databases</b>. More broadly, I am interested in anything that involves AI, data management and people.
   Relevant keywords are data exploration, data mining, debugging in machine learning, interpretability, and human-in-the-loop analytics.

    <p>I am also a music nerd&mdash;when I am not at the office, you may find me play with a band, an orchestra or enjoy one of New York's many music venues. I also like to <b>apply ML to music</b>, see examples <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-01-01-Secret-Sauce-data %}">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Previously, I was a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.uva.nl/en/home">University of Amsterdam</a> and <a href="www.cwi.nl">CWI</a> (the Netherlands), and before that I was a software engineer at JP Morgan in London (UK).</p>
